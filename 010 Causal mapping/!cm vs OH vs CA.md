# What is the difference between outcome harvesting, contribution analysis and causal mapping?

- Outcome harvesting is about collecting and explaining a (hopefully long and substantial) list of intended and unintended outcomes after the fact, and identifying how the programme contributed to the outcomes. But it's just like a list of cause-effect relationships. It can be a challenge to understand how those causes and effects overlap with one another or influence one another.

- Contribution analysis is about testing and refining a theory of change to build a credible case for contribution. It's focused on a specific theory of change and on the contributions to outcomes.
    
- Causal mapping is quite similar to both. It is not an evaluation method in its own right, but more of a tool which can assist with either. it's about visualizing and interrogating the whole web of causes and effects. It explicitly addresses the challenge of overlap and influence between causes and effects. It doesn't rely on a fixed theory of change but on the factors and links between them which are actually mentioned in documents and interviews. 

- How causal mapping can help with Outcome Harvesting: 
	- causal mapping can input a pile of Outcome Harvesting data and link them all together into the form of a larger web. 
- How causal mapping can help with Contribution Analysis:  
	- And it can assist in contribution analysis by helping to assemble all the relevant evidence along some causal pathway or pathways from intervention to outcome. Contribution Analysis can then focus on what it is best at, namely weighing up different explanations for an outcome and how much our intervention really contributed to it.
