Causal mapping distinguishes carefully between evidence for a causal link and the causal link itself. It does not provide any specific way to make causal inferences from one to the other. Causal mapping can help the evaluator to identify, code, simplify and synthesise the evidence for causal connections, but the evaluative step to make a judgement about whether one thing in fact causally influences another is left to the evaluator. This method is not useful if each piece of evidence is not clearly identified with a source.

## Examples

As explained on the [Causal Mapping website](https://www.causalmap.app/causal-mapping/):

"*A global causal map resulting from a research project can contain a large number of links and causal factors. By applying filters and other algorithms, a causal map can be queried in different ways to answer different questions, for example to simplify it, to trace specific causal paths, to identify significantly different sub-maps for different groups of sources, etc. With certain assumptions, it is possible to ask and answer questions like 'which is the largest influence' or 'which is the most positive effect'.*"

The figure below shows a map from the application Causal Map, showing coded causal statements for a project that provided farmers with agricultural training and advice in order to increase crop yields. The map has been filtered to show only outcomes downstream of the influence factor ‘Agricultural training and advice’. Numbers shown indicate how many times the links were made across all interviews.
