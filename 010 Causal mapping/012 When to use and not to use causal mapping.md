# When to use and not to use causal mapping


## When to use  causal mapping

Causal mapping is useful when seeking to understand the causal pathways influencing the outcomes of programs operating in complex settings. It helps make sense of a program and its context in stakeholdersâ€™ own words. This includes providing ways to make sense of and organise the different, but sometimes overlapping, labels that different groups use to describe the causal factors that are important to them.

Causal mapping is particularly useful for evaluations that focus on learning to inform program improvement as visual representation of causal links between context, activities and outcomes can help to facilitate the sharing and collaborative use of findings.

Causal mapping can be used during a program lifespan to inform adaptive management and as part of a final evaluation.

Causal mapping can be used to help make sense of large amounts of qualitative data.

Using this method requires expertise in coding and analysis of qualitative data.

## When not to use  causal mapping


Causal mapping is less frequently used to analyse quantitative data or to do precise mathematical modelling, e.g. of future states of a system under certain conditions.
