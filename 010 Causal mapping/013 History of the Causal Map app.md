During 20 years of conducting evaluations, the lead author became persuaded of the central importance of collecting and being able to aggregate causal propositions embedded in written and spoken data. Further interest in causal mapping arose from discussions with the other authors who had developed a qualitative impact evaluation protocol (the QuIP), which relies on causal mapping for analysis of narrative data. This prompted further expansion of the search for literature and software that could assist in systematically constructing causal maps as a way of presenting the outcome of such impact-evaluation studies. A main product of this action research has been the design of new software and detailed guidelines for causal mapping, which have already been used in many evaluations around the world.
