Table 1 shows some highlights from the extensive literature on causal mapping. Many of the key ideas were already in place by the end of the 1970s. The subsequent literature covers a variety of specific techniques to elicit maps from documents, individuals, sets of individuals and groups, with or without software support, following protocols from the purely open-ended to those which use strictly pre-defined lists of factors and links (see Hodgkinson et al (2004) for a comparison of methods), and with aims ranging from strictly idiographic (understanding individuals in specific contexts as Axelrod did) to more nomothetic, such as Tegarden et al. (2016).
