[[0132 Causal mappers believe that humans are good at thinking in terms of causal nuggets]]


> From [Powell, Copestake, et al. (2023]()

This approach suggests that our everyday causal understanding is as primary as our perception of, say, colour and arises from more than empirical observations of associations between objects or events; our ability to infer causation goes beyond and is not primarily based on noting correlations. And for all its complexity and intuitive brilliance, it is also just as fallible as our perception of colour or size.

This reaffirms our practice as evaluators of taking the causal claims and opinions of humans (experts and non-experts) seriously (Maxwell, 2004a, 2004b); indeed, this kind of information is the bread and butter of most evaluations.
