# Janus: Causal mappers face in two directions


> From [Powell, Copestake, et al. (2023)]()


..., like Janus, the causal mapper looks in two directions at once: sometimes interpreting maps as perceptions of causation but also often wanting to make the leap to inferences about actual causation. As Laukkanen and Wang (2016: 3) point out, while conceptually poles apart, in practice, the two functions can be hard to distinguish, particularly without sufficient explanation about source information and how this has been analysed. We see the job of the causal mapper as being primarily to collect and accurately visualise evidence from different sources, often leaving it to others (or to themselves wearing a different hat) to draw conclusions about what doing so reveals about the real world. This second interpretative step goes beyond causal mapping per se (Copestake, 2021; Copestake et al., 2019a; Powell et al., 2023).
