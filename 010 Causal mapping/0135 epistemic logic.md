# Epistemic logic

> From [Powell, Copestake, et al. (2023)]()

Seen as models of the world, causal maps, like systems maps, are fallible but useful: We can use inference rules (which are explicitly set out in FCMs, SDs, BBNs and CLDs and are implicit in other related approaches) to make deductions about the world. Seen as models of individualsâ€™ causal beliefs, we can arguably use analogous rules, perhaps also including rules from epistemic logic, to make deductions about what individuals ought to believe.
