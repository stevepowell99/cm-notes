Causal realism invites us to say that things have the causal power to affect other things. We can learn about causal powers (the powers that types of things have to influence other things) via constructing or observing some kind of counterfactual, but also via other routes; and maybe counterfactual arguments logically follow from facts about causal powers. 

The meaning of "X caused Y" maybe implies something about a counterfactual: broadly speaking, that Y would not have happened if X had not happened and everything else had stayed exactly the same. (Philosophers love to argue over the details.)


> Counterfactual statements follow from causal claims, they are part of their meaning.
> Counterfactual evidence can update (strengthen or weaken) the evidence for causal hypotheses.
> Counterfactual evidence is NOT the only route to updating the evidence for causal hypotheses.
