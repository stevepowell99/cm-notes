# Humans are the best detectors of causation

We can thank [Judea Pearl](http://bayes.cs.ucla.edu/WHY/) for promoting the insight that if you want to thrive in this world, you have to understand causality natively. We humans make causal connections [from an early age](http://bayes.cs.ucla.edu/WHY/jmde-why-review2018.pdf). We wouldn't survive long if we didn't.

GPT-3.5 just about understood causation. GPT-4 and more recent models understand causal connections within text very well.

Our understanding of the world is drenched with causal understanding: information and hypotheses about how things work (mostly accurate enough, sometimes not). It's really hard for us to _not_ think causally: the concept of correlation is much harder to understand than the concept of causation.

## Why are humans the best detectors of causation?

1. **Evolutionary Adaptation:**  
    Human brains have evolved specifically to detect and act on causal relationships. Survival depends on recognizing which actions lead to which outcomes—e.g., which plants are safe to eat, which animals are dangerous, and how to use tools. This evolutionary pressure has made causal reasoning a core part of human cognition.
    
2. **Intuitive Causal Models:**  
    From infancy, humans build mental models of the world that are fundamentally causal. Children naturally ask "why" questions and seek explanations, not just associations. This ability to infer hidden causes and predict effects is unique and robust compared to current artificial systems.
    
3. **Generalization and Flexibility:**  
    Humans can generalize causal knowledge across domains. For example, understanding that pushing causes movement can be applied to objects, social situations, and abstract concepts. This flexibility allows humans to detect causation even in novel or ambiguous situations.
    
4. **Counterfactual Reasoning:**  
    Humans routinely engage in counterfactual thinking—imagining what would happen if things were different. This is a hallmark of causal reasoning and is essential for planning, learning from mistakes, and scientific discovery.
    
5. **Distinguishing Correlation from Causation:**  
    While humans sometimes make errors (e.g., seeing causation where there is only correlation), we are still far better than machines at using context, background knowledge, and intervention to distinguish true causal relationships.
    
6. **Social and Cultural Transmission:**  
    Human societies accumulate and transmit causal knowledge across generations through language, stories, and education. This collective causal understanding is a foundation of science, technology, and culture.
    

## Human Strengths in Causal Inference

Causal inference is the process of determining whether and how one event or variable brings about another. 

Some writers mistakenly assume that only a controlled experiment can "really" provide a route to causal inference. 

Humans excel at causal inference not only through counterfactual reasoning, but also through a variety of other strategies:

- **Observation and Pattern Recognition:**  
    Humans are adept at noticing regularities and anomalies in their environment. We naturally look for patterns—such as temporal precedence (A happens before B), co-occurrence, and changes following interventions—that suggest causal relationships. Even without formal training, people intuitively apply principles like "no effect without a cause" and "causes precede effects."
    
- **Intervention and Experimentation:**  
    Humans frequently test their causal hypotheses by intervening in the world—changing variables and observing outcomes. This hands-on experimentation, whether in childhood play or scientific research, is a powerful tool for distinguishing causation from mere correlation.
    
- **Use of Multiple Sources of Evidence:**  
    Humans combine different types of evidence—temporal order, statistical regularities, mechanistic explanations, and observed interventions—to make robust causal inferences. We can weigh conflicting evidence, consider alternative explanations, and update our beliefs as new information arises. 

- **Comparing Hypotheses:
    Humans excel at comparing and refining competing causal hypotheses, a skill central to both realist evaluation and process tracing. In realist evaluation, people naturally ask not just “Did it work?” but “What works, for whom, in what circumstances, and why?” This involves generating multiple candidate explanations (mechanisms), considering how they interact with context, and systematically weighing evidence for and against each hypothesis.  
    Similarly, in process tracing—a method often used in social science and history—humans are adept at assembling detailed sequences of events and looking for “causal process observations” that support or refute specific causal pathways. We can identify critical pieces of evidence (so-called “smoking guns” or “hoop tests”) and use them to discriminate between rival explanations.  
    This ability to juggle multiple hypotheses, integrate diverse types of evidence, and reason through complex causal chains is a hallmark of human causal inference. It allows us to move beyond simple associations and develop nuanced, context-sensitive explanations for how and why outcomes occur.
    
    
- **Contextual and Background Knowledge:**  
    Unlike machines, humans bring a vast store of background knowledge and context to bear on causal questions. This allows us to rule out spurious correlations and recognize plausible causal mechanisms, even in complex or ambiguous situations.
    
- **Social Learning and Testimony:**  
    Humans also infer causation from the experiences and reports of others, integrating social and cultural knowledge into their causal models. This collective inference process accelerates learning and helps avoid individual errors.
    

In sum, humans are not just passive recipients of causal information; we are active causal detectives, constantly inferring, testing, and refining our understanding of how the world works. This multifaceted approach to causal inference is what makes us the best detectors of causation.
## Comparison to Machines

Recent AI models are now great at recognizing causal language patterns. 

However they are still worse than humans at reading between the lines and inferring a more connected causal story from a less explicit text. 

Most significantly, humans don't only have to infer causation from carefully prepared sets of texts, but live, on the hoof, while trying to get the kids to school and texting. 

## Conclusion

Causal reasoning is not just a feature of human cognition—it is its backbone. Our ability to detect, infer, and act on causal relationships is what allows us to navigate, survive, and thrive in a complex world. While machines are improving, humans remain the best detectors of causation, both individually and collectively.
