# Causal Mapping  *Task 1: Gathering narrative data*

  How to collect causal claims from which to draw causal maps? There are a wide variety of options, including in-depth individual interviews (Ackermann and Eden, 2004), reuse of open-ended questions in structured surveys (Jackson and Trochim, 2002), literature reviews (in which ‘sources’ can be documents rather than individuals) and archival or secondary material within which pre-existing causal claims are already made (Copestake, 2020). Other approaches aim to build consensus by using structured collaborative processes, including Delphi studies and PSM (Penn and Barbrook-Johnson, 2019). Guidelines for causal mapping may include procedures for collecting primary data, with forms of elicitation including back-chaining (‘what influenced what?’) and forward-chaining (what resulted, or could result, from this?)

  When gathering primary data, the way in which questions are asked influences the meaning of the maps and their links. For example, in the QuIP, (Copestake et al., 2019b) respondents are asked to identify causes of changes, then causes of the causes and so on. This means that most of the factors are not expressed directly as variables that may go up or down (e.g. ‘harvest’, ‘hunger’) but already as changes in something, such as ‘an improved harvest’ or ‘reduced hunger’). This has implications for how positive and negative statements are combined, as discussed in the following section.

  With primary data collection, we can distinguish between relatively closed and open approaches and whether respondents are forced to choose between pre-selected optional answers or can formulate their own (see Table 2). Interviewers may also be guided by a chaining algorithm; for example, they may be instructed to iteratively ask questions like ‘You mentioned X, please could you tell me what were the main factors that influenced X or led to it happening.’

| **Admissible answers / Scope of questions** | **Explicit**: factors are explicitly identified | **Implicit**: factors are not explicitly named |
|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Closed: questions with a predetermined focus | Which factors in this list influenced this particular event? | What influenced this particular event? |
| Open: a freer discussion | Identify the biggest change you experienced in relation to X, and list three factors that influenced it | Tell me what has changed for you in the last x years |
