  Causal mapping has some limitations. First, the credibility of the causal arguments which can be derived from a map is limited by the credibility of the original data sources. We see the job of causal mapping as collecting, organising and synthesising a large number of claims about what causes what; drawing conclusions about what this actually reveals about the world is a final step that goes beyond causal mapping per se. In specific cases, establishing explicit and context-specific rules of inference may help to make this final step. For example, it might be agreed that a reasonable threshold of evidence that C influenced E is that (i) a specified number or proportion of respondents independently mentioned the link; (ii) the connection can be plausibly explained theoretically and (iii) researchers anticipated confirmation bias and other potential sources of bias and took adequate steps to mitigate against them. See Tegarden et al. (2016) for a discussion of the role of anonymity in causal mapping in organisations.
