[[Etiograph - robustness]]

We prefer to talk about possible arguments here because this sidesteps the (also interesting) question of whether any individual source made any such argument in its entirety, with all its constituent links.9 In many circumstances, evidence for a causal path derived from different sources and contexts can be considered to strengthen the argument, whereas heaps of evidence from the same source will not. To address this kind of issue directly, we can use a complementary measure ‘source thread count’ as a measure of the strength of the argument from C to E: the number of sources, each of which mentions any complete path from C to E.
