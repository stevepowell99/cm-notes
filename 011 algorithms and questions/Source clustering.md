[[Source thread tracing]]

Where there are many sources, it may also be useful to identify variation in which sub-groups support different possible arguments. For example, Markiczy and Goldberg (1995) use dimension-reduction techniques on the table of all links reported by all sources to identify clusters of sources so that the members of each cluster are maximally similar to one another in terms of the links they report, and so that the clusters taken as a whole are maximally different from one another. These groups can also be cross-tabulated with existing metadata, to interpret them as, for example, young city-dwellers versus older rural residents.
