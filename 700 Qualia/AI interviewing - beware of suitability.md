# AI interviewing - beware of suitability
### Interviewing


Researchers should carefully consider whether the interview subject matter is compatible with this kind of approach. For example, the AI may miss subtle cues or struggle to provide appropriate support to respondents expressing distress [(Chopra and Haaland, 2023; Ray, 2023)](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?0A38Cv). We recommend that interview guidelines are tested and refined by human interviewers before being automated. No automated interview can substitute for the contextual information which a human evaluator can gain by talking directly to a respondent, ideally face-to-face and in a relevant context. 

There is likely to be a differential response rate in this kind of interview: some people are less likely to respond to an AI-driven interview than others, and this propensity may not be random.
