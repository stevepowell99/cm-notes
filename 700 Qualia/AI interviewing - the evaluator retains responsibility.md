# AI interviewing - the evaluator retains responsibility

### Autocoding

The work of the AI coder and clustering algorithms are not error-free. The coding of individual high-stakes causal links should be checked. In particular, there is a danger of accepting inaccurate results which look plausible.

This approach does not nurture substantive, large-scale theory-building of the kind expected, for example in grounded theory [(Glaser and Strauss, 1967)](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?FwD94y). However, it can do smaller-scale theory-building in the sense of capturing theories implicit in individualsâ€™ responses. 

This pipeline relieves researchers of much of the work involved in coding but it is not fully autonomous. The human evaluator is responsible for applying the techniques in a trustworthy way and for drawing valid conclusions.
