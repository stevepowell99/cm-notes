**Question for Step 1 -** **can an AI interviewer successfully gather causal information at scale?****:** Our AI interviewer was able to conduct multiple interviews with no researcher intervention at a low cost, reproducing the results of [Chopra and Haaland (2023) and Geiecke and Jaravel (2024)](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?nzAgJV). The interview transcripts read quite naturally and the process seems to have been acceptable to the interviewees.
