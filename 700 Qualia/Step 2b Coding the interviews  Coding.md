The final instructions were human-readable and could have been given to a human assistant. Instead, we gave these instructions to the online app "Causal Map", which used the GPT-4 OpenAI API. As the transcripts were quite long (each around a page of A4 in length), each was submitted separately. The “temperature” (the amount of “creativity”) was set to zero to improve reproducibility. The Causal Map app managed the housekeeping of keeping track of combining the instructions with the transcripts, watching out for any failed requests and repeating them, saving the causal links identified by the AI, etc.
