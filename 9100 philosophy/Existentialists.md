Sartre shared many core ideas with other existentialists, but there were notable differences:

- **Simone de Beauvoir**: :: She expanded existentialism into feminist theory, arguing that women's oppression is a form of "bad faith." She emphasized that women must embrace their freedom and agency to overcome socially constructed roles.

- **Albert Camus**:
?
Though often associated with existentialism, Camus rejected the label. He focused on the concept of the "absurd," the conflict between humans' search for meaning and the indifferent universe. While Sartre emphasized freedom and choice, Camus highlighted the need to embrace the absurd and live with it.

- **Martin Heidegger**:
?
An important influence on Sartre, Heidegger focused on "Being" rather than individual freedom. His concept of "thrownness" (Geworfenheit) described how individuals are always situated in a world not of their own making. While Sartre emphasized radical freedom, Heidegger focused on the interplay between individual existence and the world.

- **Karl Jaspers**:
?
- Jaspers emphasized the importance of "limit situations"â€”moments of existential crisis that force individuals to confront the fundamental questions of existence. While Sartre focused on freedom and choice, Jaspers leaned more towards the transcendental aspects of human experience.

"Existence precedes :: essence" is essentially saying that we aren't born with a predetermined purpose or nature. Instead, we create our own meaning and values through our choices and actions. The philosophical language can be dense and off-putting, but the core idea is straightforward: we define who we are by what we do, not by any inherent essence or destiny.
