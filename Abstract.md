This paper presents an AI-assisted causal mapping pipeline for gathering and analysing stakeholder perspectives at scale. Evidence relevant to constructing a program theory, as well as evidence for the causal influences flowing through it, are both collected at the same time, without the evaluator needing to possess a prior theory. The method uses an AI interviewer to conduct interviews, automated coding to identify causal claims in the transcripts, and causal mapping to synthesise and visualise results. The authors tested this approach by interviewing participants about problems facing the USA. Results indicate the method can efficiently collect and process qualitative data, producing useful causal maps that capture respondents' views. The paper discusses the potential of this approach for evaluation, enabling rapid, large-scale qualitative analysis. It also notes limitations and ethical concerns, emphasising the need for human oversight and verification.
