# Automated causal mapping can help answer evaluation questions

**Question for Step 3 -** **can automated causal mapping help answer evaluation questions?****:** An overview map was produced which included over 40% of the causal claims identified within the transcripts, using just 11 relatively broad factor labels. 

The most central factor with the highest number of citations was Economic stress, which is a plausible result, with plausible connections to other factors. 

We can use the map to identify and weigh up the evidence for contributions from and to individual factors. For example, the major contributions to Economic stress are Government policy and Covid-19, as well as “self-loops” mentioned by 46 sources, i.e. where one aspect of Economic stress was seen as causing another. 

All such results depend on the (not automated) decisions made during the clustering process: how many clusters to use, whether to intervene in labelling, etc. This situation is closely parallel to decisions facing a statistician who has to identify variables for, say, structural equation modelling [(Goertz, 2020: 136 ff)](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?Eu6HAG). 

Comparison of citation frequency across timepoints was able to show that some links were mentioned significantly more than others, illustrating how this kind of map could be used to explore changes in systems (or in mental models of systems) over time.
