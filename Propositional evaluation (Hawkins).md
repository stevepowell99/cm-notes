Propositional Evaluation is dedicated to evidence-based policy but shifts the focus of evaluation from a concern with 'what happened?' and even 'what works?' - towards 'what makes that a good idea'? and 'how can we make it work?'

​

​

This approach is based on an ancient tool for deductive logic combined with a specific theory of causality supported by scientific methods for gathering data. The first step is to treat a policy or program as a proposition or argument that sets out how it is intended to work (i.e how the premises in the argument support the conclusion). People can discuss (or evaluate) if this proposition makes sense 'on paper' before we attempt to see if it makes sense 'in reality'. People familiar with program logic will recognise the concept - Propositional Design Logic (PDL) - is a more explicitly logical form of the outcomes hierarchy with an explicit theory of causality focused on necessary and sufficient conditions. Yes, this is like program logic - but an explicitly logical and powerful version that speaks to anyone regardless of their technical expertise.

​

Propositional Evaluation is an approach to evaluation that is inclusive, credible, useful, and cost-effective. Outcomes Assurance is the associated practice for making it happen. An end-to-end process to manage risks to program failure - providing confidence that it will work, and assurance that it is working, or a rational means of choosing something else if it cannot, will not, or is not working.
